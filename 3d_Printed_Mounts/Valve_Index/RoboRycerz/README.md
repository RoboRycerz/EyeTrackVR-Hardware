# Custom Valve Index frunk with fan and face tracker mounts v1

Designed to fit two 40mm fans (specifically Noctua's NF-A4x10) and for inside mount of two SeedStudio XIAO ESP32-S3 Sense ESPs.

Fans and the basket are friction fitted, no need for additional screws - fan cover can be mounted using 2.5mm zip ties or by gluing it on.

Exits for an external USB hub and flat USB cables on the top.
